Welcome!
========

You have come across the intersection of the OpenDaylight & Openstack Project. It aims to tame your (cloud) networking!

Background:
===========

There is a massive effort underway to improve the stability of using Opendaylight as the layer 2 solution for Openstack. Above are a set of scripts used by an Intel team to find bugs and failing Tempest tests. The scripts are run by a Jenkins server, which deploys Vagrant VMs to build each scenario and run the appropriate tests.
